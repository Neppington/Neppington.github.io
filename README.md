# On Hosting your Resume on GitHub (and learning Technical Communication principles!)

Are you looking for a **free, simple way** to host your resume online, and *be able to edit and update it on the fly*? This README tutorial will guide you through the process using the accessible, modern tools of GitHub Pages, Markdown, and Jekyll!  
Along the way, you'll also gain some insight into the modern technical communication principles that helped bring this project to life: Andrew Etter, in his book *Modern Technical Writing: An Introduction to Software Documentation*, outlines the methodologies that influenced the usage of these specific tools that you will use to host your resume (and bolster your technical communication toolkit)! 

**Important note:** this README tutorial will be taught using the ***GitHub's browser client.*** This tutorial will **not** cover the console client or the desktop client variants of GitHub.

## Prerequisites

* a GitHub Account
    * If you don't have one, visit [GitHub's website](https://github.com/) and make your own free account!
* (enough) Markdown know-how
    * Not sure what Markdown is or how to use it? Refer to [More Resources](#more-resources) for a quick tutorial to get you started!
* your resume, properly formatted in Markdown (saved in **.md** format!)
    * Refer to [More Resources](#more-resources) for a relatively simple, online Markdown editor to use.

## Setup Process
*This tutorial assumes that you have not made previous repositories (Git's encompassing your project and its history), and **prefaces each major section** of the hosting process with some relevant insight from Etter's software documentation principles.*

### Preface: GitHub
To start, why are you using GitHub Pages to host your resume, anyway? The answer lies in the current state of the field of computer science, and the common tools that lead the industry. GitHub is known as a distributed control version system (DVCS), which, as Etter mentions, has become widely-used among computer scientists for it's performance, capability for offline work, and ability to work concurrently with other contributors.  
...That being said, **technical writers use these same DVCSs since developers prefer utilizing them.** By using DVCSs, we can more closely work with software developers, as well as allowing more opportunities for potential contributors than if we used more dedicated software documentation tools.

These core features of DVCSs are what drive the principle of using them so often. Now, let's get to setting yours up!


#### Creating your first repository
1. Login to your GitHub Account.
2. Select the **New** button, found on your GitHub homepage.  
**RESULT**: You will be redirected to the repository creation page.

3. Enter your repository name, ***which must start with your username and followed by `.github.io`***, as in this template:  
    `[your username].github.io`  
    * If you don't follow this **exact** format, your site won't display at all!
4. Set your repository to **Public** by selecting the dialog option.
5. Select **Create repository**.

**RESULT:** Congrats, with this you should have your first-ever repository up and running!
